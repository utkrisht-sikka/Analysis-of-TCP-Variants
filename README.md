# Analysis-of-TCP-Variants
Team project in which we studied QUIC protocol and TCP variants : Veno, Cubic and Vegas. Comparison was done in various surrounding conditions like Ethernet vs WiFi,
high vs low congestion, high vs low signal strength. Iperf was used in preliminary testing of setup. Wireshark was used for capturing packets and generating plots.
Some of the parameters we measured were throughput, packet lengths, no. of retransimissions, no. of dupacks, no. of out of order packets and packet errors.
